I began to\n            consume a lot of online videos to give me ideas and saved them in a\n            folder on YouTube. My growing collection quickly became hard to\n            manage. Retrieving the exact video I wanted was a question of chance\n            and I was getting frustrated. One quick fix was to create several\n            folders but that didn't really solve the problem because the\n            organization was not systematic and I like things to be well\n            organized.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I wanted a library to group all my favorite videos and filter them\n            by different criteria such as the style of yoga, the duration, the\n            level and any additional tags. I decided to create it.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Functionality</h3>\n          <p>\n            Yogi libary offers a curated list of my favorite yoga videos.
